# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! If you are here means that you love the neovim as much as I. And you can contribute for this project!

# Rules

Here are some rules that I try to follow rigidly. Remembering that they can be changed throughout the project.

- Keep all the important code commented 
- Follow the major structure 
- Have only one configuration file

**In case of sudden change in structure, explain in the Pull Request**

# Read the README

On the [README](https://github.com/douglastofoli/wizard-nvim/blob/main/contribute/README.md) you can read how to start contributing.
